# History

## Introduction

Transparent display technology, like many other technologies, began in a series of research labs under small-scale and controlled projects. Originally such technology was not for commercial or consumer purposes, but as the manufacturing and material properties of the displays have evolved, they have begun to move into those markets.

The technology to produce these displays is not particularly new, "[in] 2011 Samsung became the world's first company to mass produce transparent LCD panels." [1] Advancements in opaque OLED technology, combined with years of research and manufacturing practice has resulted in larger and more reliable transparent displays that can be sold to commercial customers, and perhaps soon to consumers.

## Research

Contributions from various research teams have contributed to the overall knowledge base that has produced these transparent displays. Below are some examples of technological steps forward that have contributed to the current state of this technology.

### Transparent Electronics

A paper from December 2009 [2] discussed a new type of "transparent thin-film-transistors (TFTs)" [2] which are a crucial component in building OLED displays. When attempting to build a fully transparent display, every opaque component reduces the amount of light that can come through the surface, so creating transparent TFTs allows more light to come through these components.

### Single Colour Plastic Coating

In 2014 researchers from MIT created a thin plastic film that could be applied to a piece of glass to provide a highly transparent, single-colour display. In contrast, produced transparent displays at the time were "directly integrated into the glass: organic light-emitting diodes for the display, and transparent electronics to control them. But such systems are complex and expensive, and their transparency is limited." [2] 

## Summary

Transparent display technology uses many of the same concepts discovered and refined for the opaque LCD and OLED markets. Transparency was not discovered and produced by any single entity, instead the technology is a result of years of research and refinements to this existing technology. Existing components used to build LCD and OLED screens could be made smaller, enlarging the transparent space between them, and some of these components could be made transparent themselves. As more light is able to come through the display service, the transparency of the device improves.
