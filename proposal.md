**Project name:** Transparent & Touchscreen Displays

**Team members (solo):** Daniel Frankcom


## 1

### Overview

This project will examine the history, technical operation, and importance of transparent display technology. It will also examine the effects and workings of capacitive touch technology as applied to these displays.

### Importance

Transparent displays (capacitive or not) have been gaining traction in recent years, driven by a number of businesses who wish to explore the technology for very different purposes. Just some of the possible applications are:

- Heads-up displays
- Product presentation boxes in retail stores
- Augmented reality

The technology is still in a highly developmental phase at the moment, however there are certainly instances of use in the market. I have seen such a display in-person in a presentation box for a physical product, and was surprised to see such a display fully operational. Until recently I was not aware that the technology was ready for use. In the coming years I expect the usage for transparent displays to increase dramatically, as the technology will become more stable, proven, vibrant, and useful.

Though I see two past projects that covered OLED displays, these topics are relatively unrelated to this proposal, as they do not mention or focus on the transparency of these displays. Standard OLED displays are well understood and mass-produced for consumer market mobile devices and televisions, however transparent display technology is still in an infantile stage.

### Deliverable

The deliverable for this project will be an extensive report on the history, technical operation, and importance of transparent display technologies. The report will contain diagrams for transparent OLED and LCD display layers, as well as capacitive touch layers.

The report will also examine the existing market for such displays. It will describe consumer products that include such displays, as well as displays themselves that can be purchased for engineers or other interested parties to play with.

### Schedule
